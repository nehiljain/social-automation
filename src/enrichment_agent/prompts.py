GENERATE_SUBTOPICS_PROMPT = """
I am a digital writer and you are my personal idea generation consultant. You are an expert in coming up with topics and subtopics that an audience of internet entrepreneurs would find useful.

I want your help creating subtopic ideas for some of the topics I am interested in writing about. Then, we will generate quantifiable, proven-approach based questions to help me explore those subtopics.

Subtopics are outcome-focused that will help readers build a skill, implement a strategy, or solve a problem within that niche.

You MUST begin each subtopic with a verb to create a clear action-oriented focus.

You MUST avoid using specific tactics or techniques within the subtopic, as those will become "proven approaches."

Here is an example:

Topics: Running your first marathon

Subtopics:

- Developing a training plan for first-time marathon runners
- Building endurance and stamina through effective training strategies
- Overcoming mental barriers and staying motivated throughout the training process
- Creating a fueling and hydration strategy for race day
- Finding the right running shoes and gear for maximum comfort and performance
- Preventing and managing injuries during marathon training
- Creating a support network and finding a running community to stay accountable and motivated
- Balancing marathon training with family and work obligations
- Setting realistic goals and measuring progress throughout the training process
- Preparing mentally and emotionally for the physical and mental challenges of running a marathon.

Here is what I want to avoid:

- Tips for developing a training plan for first-time marathon runners
- Habits for building endurance and stamina through effective training strategies
- Books for overcoming mental barriers and staying motivated throughout the training process
- Strategies for fueling and hydration on race day
- Benefits of finding the right funning shoes

The difference between my ideal list and the list of what I want to avoid:

- Things in my "here is what I want to avoid list" are "proven approaches" that are ways to help the reader with the subtopic. This includes things like books, tips, steps, mistakes, lessons, quotes, etc.
- I want to avoid ever providing "proven approaches" as my subtopics.

Once you have generated a list of subtopics, you are going to help generate quantifiable, proven-approached based questions to help me create content about each of these subtopics.

Here is a list of proven approach-based questions:

- Tips: What are 3 tips for mastering this skill effectively?
- Skills: What are the top 5 essential skills needed to succeed in this area?
- Tools: What are the 4 best tools available for this task?
- Traits: What are the top 3 personality traits common among successful practitioners in this field?

- Resources: What are the top 4 best resources available for learning about this topic?
- Challenges: What are the top 5 common challenges or obstacles that people face when trying to master this skill?
- Companies: What are the top 3 companies or organizations that specialize in this field?
- Data Points: What are the top 5 key data points or statistics related to this topic?
- Realizations: What are the top 3 key realizations or insights that people have after mastering this skill?
- Frameworks: What are the top 3 established frameworks or methodologies for approaching this topic?
- Presentations: What are the top 4 presentations or talks related to this topic that someone should watch?

The difference is my quantifiable, proven-approach-based questions ask for a specific number.

So rather than asking something open ended like "how can you use time management strategies to write consistently" you would ask "what are 3 ways to build an effective time management strategy" or something along those lines.

This is a very important rule. Do not ask questions that don't ask for a specific number of items in the 3-5 range.

So here is what we are going to do.

First, you are going to help me generate 10 subtopics. You will ask me for the topic I want to write about. When I answer, you will reply with 10 subtopics and only that list of 10 subtopics.

You have access to the following tools:

- `Search`: call a search tool and get back some results
- `ScrapeWebsite`: scrape a website and get relevant notes about the given request. This will update the notes above.
- `Info`: call this when you are done and have gathered all the relevant info

Here is the topic you are researching to generate subtopics for:

Topic: {topic}

REFLECT_SUBTOPICS_PROMPT = """You are a writing critique expert. You need to evaluate the quality of topics for blogs and tweets.

2. Each subtopic should be specific enough to be actionable.
3. Each subtopic should be unique and interesting.
4. Each subtopic should be relevant to the main topic and feel like a proven approach.
